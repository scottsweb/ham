# HAM (Home Automation Machine)

This is version two of HAM ([see version one](https://github.com/scottsweb/ham/tree/master)), the host machine is now running [Fedora Silverblue](https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/) and uses [Podman](https://podman.io/) instead of Docker. This allows the containers to run rootless and have a slightly more stable system upon which to build my #homelab. I have also upgraded from a Raspberry Pi to a x86 system with a small footprint and low power demands.

I am mostly just publishing the relevant `docker-compose` / `podman-compose` files that are grouped into pods around certain pieces of functionality like home automation or media. I think this makes more sense, especially as more of my Home Assistant config is moved from YAML to the database.

## General / OS tweaks

### Packages

I layer the following packages:

```
rpm-ostree install sshfs docker-compose podman-docker podman-compose wireguard-tools cronie
```

`podman-docker` allows you to use the [Monitor Docker Home Assistant component](https://github.com/ualex73/monitor_docker) for automating and monitoring containers.

### Podman

Enable the Podman socket and set the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable for more Docker like behaviour:

```
systemctl --user enable podman.socket
systemctl --user start podman.socket
systemctl --user status podman.socket
```

Add the following to your `~/.bash_profile`

```
export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/user/$UID/podman/podman.sock
```

Reference: [Use Docker Compose with Podman](https://fedoramagazine.org/use-docker-compose-with-podman-to-orchestrate-containers-on-fedora/)

Test the Docker API with:

```
sudo curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --unix-socket /run/user/1000/podman/podman.sock http://localhost/_ping
```

Reference: [Using Podman and Docker Compose](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/podman-docker-compose)

Start the Podman restart service (restarts containers set to `restart: always`) after a reboot:

```
systemctl --user enable podman-restart.service
systemctl --user start podman-restart.service
```

With the release of Podman 5 (Fedora 40), there are [some breaking changes with the switch from slirp4netns to pasta](https://blog.podman.io/2024/03/podman-5-0-breaking-changes-in-detail/). This caused two of my containers to break; Caddy and WireGuard. I still need to read more into but for now the fix is to switch back to slirp4netns for container networking by adding the following to `~/.config/containers/containers.conf`:

```
[network]
default_rootless_network_cmd = "slirp4netns"
```

The system then needed to be rebooted and containers were behaving as before.

### Allow long running tasks

As Silverblue is a desktop OS, it tries to shutdown long running tasks (including Podman containers). This can be turned off by running: `loginctl enable-linger`, check the status with `ls /var/lib/systemd/linger`, then reboot.

### Connectivity check

Fedora has a built in connectivity check that phones home rather frequently. It's probably more useful on a system that uses WiFi, but as this machine is connected via Ethernet I decided to turn it off. `sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf`:

```
[connectivity]
enabled=false
uri=http://fedoraproject.org/static/hotspot.txt
response=OK
interval=300
```

Then run `systemctl restart NetworkManager` for the changes to be picked up.

### System time

I found that my system time was getting out of sync, so enabled NTP

```
timedatectl set-ntp yes
timedatectl
```

Reference: [Configuring date and time](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/latest/system-administrators-guide/basic-system-configuration/Configuring_the_Date_and_Time/)

### SSH

Tweak some SSH settings to restrict access:

```
PermitRootLogin	no
PermitEmptyPasswords no
X11Forwarding no
PasswordAuthentication no
AllowUsers username@192.168.1.* username@10.80.x.x (example for more IPs)
```

These tweaks can be added to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-redhat.conf` and applied with `sudo systemctl reload sshd`.

### Cron

`cronie` is a layered package (`rpm-ostree install cronie`).

```
sudo nano /etc/cron.allow
# add your username

systemctl enable crond.service
systemctl start crond.service

crontab -e
```

### USB sleep / Auto suspend

To save power Fedora will sleep USB devices. We need to turn this off for Deconz and the Zigbee USB stick (ConBee II):

```
sudo rpm-ostree kargs --append=usbcore.autosuspend=-1

# check
cat /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/autosuspend
```

### Gnome suspends after 15 minutes

Since Fedora 38 the server started auto suspending after 15 minutes. This was due to a settings change that can be adjusted with:

```
# check state of power settings
sudo -u gdm dbus-run-session gsettings list-recursively org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power | grep sleep

# set to 0 to disable autosuspend on power
sudo -u gdm dbus-run-session gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-ac-timeout 0
```

## Containers

### Caddy

I am using Caddy as a local reverse proxy. Along with the Pi-hole it allows custom domains like `homeassistant.lan` for each of the services. Caddy needs access to port 80 and 443 so the firewall needs to be opened:

```
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=FedoraWorkstation --add-service=http
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=FedoraWorkstation --add-service=http --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=FedoraWorkstation --add-service=https
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=FedoraWorkstation --add-service=https --permanent
```

`firewall-cmd --get-default-zone` will let you know which zone you are currently using.

### Pi-hole

Pi-hole also needs a few tweaks (including a hole in the local firewall):

```
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=53
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
# add net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=53

sudo nano /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
# add DNSStubListener=no

sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager

sudo firewall-cmd --zone=FedoraWorkstation --add-port=53/udp
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=FedoraWorkstation --add-port=53/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=FedoraWorkstation --add-port=53/udp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=FedoraWorkstation --add-port=53/tcp
```

### Home Assistant

The `nmap` scanner has to run in unprivileged mode. To do this modify the Nmap Tracker options in the Home Assistant UI and add `--unprivileged` to the raw configurable scan options.

The container needs access to USB which is a little tricky using Podman. You need to create a udev rule that changes the group and owner of the USB device when its plugged in so the container can access it.


```
# set policy for containers to use USB devices in SELinux
setsebool -P container_use_devices on

ls -l /dev/ttyUSB0

# change owner of /dev/ttyUSB0 to your username
lsusb
sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-skyconnect.rules

# add the following to the rule file (based on what you get from lsusb)
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="10c4", ATTRS{idProduct}=="ea60", OWNER="username", GROUP="username"

# apply changes
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

### Samba

The [Samba container](https://github.com/crazy-max/docker-samba) requires a hole in the firewall:

```
sudo dnf install samba
sudo systemctl enable smb --now
firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=FedoraWorkstation --add-service=samba
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

Reference: [Setting up Samba on Fedora](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/samba/)


### VPN / WireGuard

It took some time to get WireGuard running rootless but the `docker-compose.yaml` file in the `vpn` folder is now working. [I spent a great deal of time experimenting with this](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15120) and I cannot exactly remember all the steps I took. I think the main thing you will need to do is enable the kernel module for WireGuard if it's not already enabled... and a few others for ip management:

```
# see which modules are loaded 
lsmod

# enable required kernel modules
sudo touch /etc/modules-load.d/wireguard.conf
```

Add the following to `wireguard.conf`:

```
# load wireguard at boot
wireguard

# modules for nat
ip_tables
iptable_filter
iptable_nat
xt_MASQUERADE
xt_nat
```

Reboot and the container should now start.
