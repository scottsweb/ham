# Definitions and Line formats #
################################

# lines can be blank, or start with the words: send, set #
#
# A line is divided into words, separated by spaces
#
# A word is either a string of non-blank characters, everything
# between double quotes, or an equal sign.
#
# SEND LINE FORMAT:
#   send DATATYPE [DATATYPE] ...
#        where DATATYPE = cidlog, cidinfo
#
# SET LINE FORMAT:
#   set ITEM = VALUE [ITEM = VALUE] ...
#       where ITEM = announce, audiofmt, blacklist, cidalias, cidlog,
#                    cidlogmax, cidnoname, datalog, gencid, hangup,
#                    hupmode, hupname, huprmd, ignore1, initcid,
#                    initstr, lineid, lockfile, nomodem,
#                    noserial, pickup, pidfile, port,
#                    regex, send, ttyclocal, ttyport, ttyspeed,
#                    verbose, whitelist

##########################
# Log file verbose level #
##########################

# Set the verbose level
# The default value is 1, the range is 1-7
# verbose levels 8 and 9 are only for the command line
# set verbose = 3

############################
# Log and Info for Clients #
############################

# Send the call log to a client when connected
# The default is not to send the call log file
send cidlog

# Send call info (LINE and RING) to a client at each ring
# The default is not to send the call info line
send cidinfo

#####################
# NCID Network Port #
#####################

# The default TCP/IP port is 3333
# set port = 3334

######################
# PID, and Log Files #
######################

# Set pidfile to /var/run/ncidd.pid in rc and init scripts
# The default is no PID file
# set pidfile = /var/run/ncidd.pid

# The default CID call log file: /var/log/cidcall.log
# (also make the change in /etc/logrotate.d/ncidd
#  and also /etc/ncid/ncidrotate.conf)
# set cidlog = /var/log/cidcall.log

# Set the maximum size in bytes for the CID log file
# The default is 110,000 bytes and the maximum is 100,000,000
# Do not include commas when setting cidlogmax
# set cidlogmax = 500000

# The default tty data log file: /var/log/ciddata.log
# the log file must exist, ncidd will not create it
#  (also make the change in /etc/logrotate.d/ncidd
#   and also /etc/ncid/ncidrotate.conf)
# set datalog = /var/log/ciddata.log

####################
# HANGUP EXTENSION #
####################

# ncidd can call a hangup extension (external script or program)
# as a way to provide additional functionality.
#
# Summary of the three hangup settings:
#   set hupname -- the name of the hangup script or program
#   set hupmode -- enables the hangup extension with a hangup mode
#                  and disables it if hupmode = 0.
#   set huprmd  -- optional voice file to be played if hupmode = 3
#
# Only the name of the hangup extension name is required for "hupname".
# The hangup name must begin with "hangup-"
#   examples: hangup-on-telemarketers
#             hangup-debt-collector
#             hangup-mesg
#
# If your extension is not in the default path, specify a full path name.
# The default hangup path: /usr/share/ncid/extensions/
# The default hangup name: hangup-skel
# set hupname = hangup-message
#
# The server hangup extension is enabled by "hupmode"
# It has the same modes as "hangup": 0, 1, 2, 3
# See the "Automatic Call Hangup" section below for mode descriptions.
# hupmode = 0        Default: do not execute the hangup extension
# set hupmode = 1

# The hangup extension can return a voice recording file name to play.
# If a voice recording file name is not returned, the "huprmd" file
# is used.  If "huprmd" is not set, the "announce" voice file is used.
# Only the name of the voice file is required when you set "huprmd".
#
# If your recording name is not in the default path, specify a full path name.
# The default recording path: /usr/share/ncid/recordings/
# The default recording name: the same as the "announce" recording name
# set huprmd = NotInService.rmd

########################################
# Alias, Blacklist and Whitelist Files #
########################################

# The default CID alias file: /etc/ncid/ncidd.alias
set cidalias = /etc/ncid/ncidd.alias

# The default blacklist file: /etc/ncid/ncidd.blacklist
set blacklist = /etc/ncid/ncidd.blacklist

# The default whitelist file: /etc/ncid/ncidd.whitelist
set whitelist = /etc/ncid/ncidd.whitelist

# The alias, blacklist, and whitelist files use simple expressions
# to match on a Caller ID but full regular expressions can be used
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression
#
# regex = 0           Default: do not use regular expressions
# regex = 1           use regular expressions
set regex = 1

# An alias that includes a telephone number depends on the number
# received from a call.  In the US and Canada, a leading 1 is not
# always part of the telephone number.  For instance, Vonage always
# includes the 1 on incoming calls but on outgoing calls the 1 is
# optional.
# If the ignore1 option is set, a leading 1 is ignored in both
# the caller number and the alias definition.
#
# The ignore1 option is only for use in the US and Canada.
#
# ignore1 = 0 default: the leading 1 is required in the alias,
#                      blacklist, and whitelist files
# ignore1 = 1          ignore the leading 1 in a call and in
#                      the alias, blacklist, and whitelist files
# set ignore1 = 1

############################
# Telephone Line Indicator #
############################

# Set the line indicator if you want it displayed for the modem.
# or if you have more than one telephone line.  The default value
# for lineid is '-' and is not displayed.  Setting it to any other
# value will display it.
#
# You can set lineid to 'POTS' (Plain Old Telephone Service) to
# have it displayed or the last 4 digits of your number if you
# have more than one telephone line.
# lineid default: -
# set lineid = POTS

################################
# Generate a generic Caller ID #
################################

# Generate a generic Caller ID at ring 2 if one is not received
# from the modem either because the telco is not sending it or
# because the modem does not support it.  This feature requires
# the modem to indicate each time the modem rings.

# gencid = 0          never generate a generic Caller ID
# gencid = 1 default: generate a generic Caller ID when needed
# set gencid = 0

#############################
# CID NAME sent or not sent #
#############################

# If your Telco does not send a name with the Caller ID, you can
# configure ncidd to receive a CID without a name so it does not
# need to wait until ring 2 to determine that no name was sent.
# WARNING: if this option is set and a name is sent, it is ignored

# cidnoname = 0 default: CID does contain a name
# cidnoname = 1          CID does not contain a name
# set cidnoname = 1


#########################
# Automatic Call Hangup #
#########################

# The automatic call hangup feature requires a modem to hangup
# the call, the Caller ID information may be obtained from either
# a modem or a gateway.

# The server will hangup a call when it receives the Caller ID
# provided the name or number is in the blacklist file, but not
# in the whitelist file.

# Set hangup to a 0 to disable the automatic hangup
#
# hangup = 0          Default: do not terminate a call
# set hangup = 0

# Set hangup to a 1 if you would like ncidd to terminate a
# call that has its name or number in a blacklist file but
# not in a whitelist file.
#
# hangup = 1          terminate the call
# set hangup = 1

# Set hangup to a 2 if you would like ncidd to pickup and generate
# FAX tones before terminating a call that has its name or number
# in a blacklist file but not in a whitelist file.  Not all modems
# support FAX.  If FAX is not supported the server will switch to
# "hangup = 1" and generate a warning in the server log file.
#
# hangup = 2          generate FAX tones, then terminate the call
set hangup = 2

#
# Modems that support FAX normally in require a pickup command before
# sending the FAX command to start the FAX tones.  Some older modems
# will not generate FAX tones if a pickup command is sent.  If no FAX
# tones are heard, do not send the pickup command.
#
# pickup = 1          Default: send the pickup command
# pickup = 0          do not send the pickup command
# set pickup = 0

# Set hangup to a 3 if you would like to play an announcement
# before terminating a call that has its name or number
# in a blacklist file but not in a whitelist file.  Not all modems
# support VOICE.  If VOICE is not supported the server will switch
# to "hangup = 1" and generate a warning in the server log file.
#
# hangup = 3          play an announcement then terminate the call
# set hangup = 3
#
# Default announce file: 8-bit unsigned PCM at a 8000 Hz sample rate
# Default announce file: NumberDisconnected.rmd
# The announce file is located in /usr/share/ncid/recordings
#   unless a full path is given in 'set announce'
# Choose one of these announce files:
# set announce = CallingDeposit.rmd
# set announce = CannotBeCompleted.rmd
# set announce = NotInService.rmd
# set announce = NumberDisconnected.rmd
#
# Set the audio data format to one of the Modem Sampling Methods
# returned by the modem command: AT+VSM=?
#
#   The default announce file expects:
#       Manufacturer: CONEXANT
#       Modem Identifier: CX93001-EIS_V0.2013-V92
#           NOTE: only CX93001 is important the rest of the line can change
#       Modem Sampling Method: 130,"UNSIGNED PCM",8,0,8000,0,0
#       Modem Sampling Method slected: 130
#
#   The default announce file will also work with:
#       Manufacturer: U.S. Robotics
#       Modem Identifier: U.S. Robotics 56K FAX USB V1.2.23
#           NOTE: the version must be v1.2.23 or later
#       Modem audio data formats: 128,"8-BIT LINEAR",(7200,8000,11025)
#       Modem audio data format slected: 128,8000
#
# default: audiofmt = "AT+VSM=130"   # CONEXANT
# set audiofmt = "AT+VSM=128,8000"   # U.S. Robotics

#######################
# Serial or No Serial #
#######################

# Normally a serial device is required to capture CID information.
# If you are using one or more gateways and do not have a serial
# device, set noserial to 1.

# If noserial is set to 1 and hangup is set to 0, the TTY Configuration,
# Modem, and Modem Initialization set commands are not used.

#  NETWORK AND NO SERIAL: noserial = 1 (do not use a serial port)
#  SERIAL AND NETWORK:    noserial = 0 (default - use a serial port)
# set noserial = 1

###################################################################
## NOTE: if noserial is set to 1 and hangup is set to 0, nothing ##
##       needs to be configured beyond this point.               ##

# TTY Configuration #
#####################

## Required if noserial is set to 0 or hangup is set to 1

# The default tty port:
# set ttyport = /dev/modem                # general build
# set ttyport = /dev/com1                 # cygwin build
# set ttyport = /dev/cu.modem             # Mac OS X internal modem
# set ttyport = /dev/cu.usbmodem24680241  # Mac OS X USB modem (DualComm, Zoom)
# set ttyport = /dev/ttyS0                # Linux Serial Port 0
# set ttyport = /dev/ttyACM0              # Linux USB modem 0

# The default tty port speed: 115200
# The tty speed can be one of: 115200, 38400, 19200, 9600, 4800
# set ttyspeed = 4800 # NetCallerID port speed
# set ttyspeed = 9600 # TCI serial device port speed

# Ignore tty control signals for internal modems and 3 wire serial cables
#   Disable tty control signals: ttyclocal = 1
#   Enable tty control signals: ttyclocal = 0 (default)
# set ttyclocal = 1

# The lockfile name is generated automatically for the following distributions
# when tty port is /dev/modem:
#    Fedora : /var/lock/lockdev/LCK..modem
#    FreeBSD: /var/spool/lock/LCK..modem
#    Mac    : /var/spool/uucp/LCK..modem
#    Ubuntu : /var/lock/LCK..modem
#
# The default lockfile name when not build to a distribution
# and the tty port is /dev/modem:
#    Default: /var/lock/LCK..modem
#
# You can also set the lockfile manually for a OS not distributed
# when tty port is /dev/modem:
#    Debian : /var/lock/LCK..modem
#
# set lockfile = /var/lock/lockdev/LCK..ttyS0

# set nomodem = 1

########################
# Modem Initialization #
########################

# initstr is required if noserial is set to 0 and nomodem is set to 0
# or hangup is set to 1

# see http://www.modemhelp.org for help with init strings

# The default modem initialization is: "AT Z S0=0 E1 V1 Q0"
# set initstr = "ATE1V1Q0"
#
# If minicom can talk to the modem but ncidd fails, use the Minicom init string
# Minicom initialization string is "AT S7=45 S0=0 L1 V1 X4 &c1 E1 Q0"
# set initstr = "ATS7=45S0=0L1V1X4&c1E1Q0"

# set initstr = "ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &C1 &D2 +FCLASS=0"

# The U.S.Robotics USR5631 56K Faxmodem has a +GCI command to set the
# country code to adjust parameters for a particular telephone network
# (perhaps other modems do also).  See the following on how to set +GCI
